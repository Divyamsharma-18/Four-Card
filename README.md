## 🌟 Overview

This project is a **responsive Four Card Feature Section**, inspired by a Frontend Mentor challenge.
It’s all about **simplicity, balance, and crisp design** — showing how powerful clean layouts and a few lines of CSS magic can be.

Think of it as the *minimalist cousin* of a product landing page — no JavaScript chaos, no complex frameworks, just pure HTML & CSS elegance. ✨

## 🧩 Layout Breakdown

The page features four distinct cards:

* **Supervisor** – Watches everything. Probably needs coffee. ☕
* **Team Builder** – The “let’s make a startup” enthusiast. 🚀
* **Karma** – Keeps things balanced and peaceful. 🧘‍♀️
* **Calculator** – The numbers person of the group. 🧮

Each card sits inside a responsive grid, forming a balanced, center-aligned layout that looks good on both 4K screens and mobile phones (because we respect all devices equally here).

## 🧠 What I Learned

* CSS Grid makes layouts feel like Lego — snap, align, done.
* A little padding goes a long way (no one likes text glued to borders).
* You don’t need React or Tailwind for *everything*. Sometimes, just two files can do the job. 😉
* Designing for mobile first saves hours of resizing misery later.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Building this was a small reminder that **elegance lives in simplicity**.
It’s like writing a haiku with HTML and CSS — short, structured, but deeply satisfying.

If this project had a tagline, it would be:

> *“Four cards, infinite symmetry.”*
